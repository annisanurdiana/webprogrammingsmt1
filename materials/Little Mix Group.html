                Little Mix released their debut album DNA in 2012, which peaked inside the top 10 in ten countries including the UK and US. This made Little Mix the first girl group since the Pussycat Dolls to reach the US top five with their debut album, as well as earning the highest debut US chart position for a British girl group's first release, breaking the record previously held by the Spice Girls. The group's second album Salute (2013) became their second album to debut inside the top 10 in both the UK and US. Their third album Get Weird was released in 2015, and was certified double platinum in the UK. Their fourth album Glory Days (2016) became their first number one album in the UK, and also achieved the longest-reigning girl group number one album since the Spice Girls' debut album 20 years earlier, and the highest first week UK album sales for a girl band since 1997. The album was also certified triple platinum by the BPI and became the best-selling album of the decade by a girl group, selling over one million copies in the UK alone. In the UK, the group has earned four number-one singles, including "Wings", "Black Magic" and "Shout Out to My Ex". Their fifth studio album LM5 was released in 2018 to generally favourable reviews and was certified gold. The group have sold over 50 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling girl groups of all time.

                    When you hold me in the street and you kiss me on the dance floor <br>
                    I wish that it could be like that<br>
                    Why can't it be like that<br>
                    'Cause I'm yours<br>
                    We keep behind closed doors<br>
                    Every time I see you, I die a little more<br>
                    Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls<br>
                    It'll never be enough<br>
                    It's obvious you're meant for me<br>
                    <br>
                    Every piece of you, it just fits perfectly<br>
                    Every second, every thought, I'm in so deep<br>
                    But I'll never show it on my face<br>
                    But we know this, we got a love that is homeless<br>
                    Why can't you hold me in the street?<br>
                    Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?<br>
                    I wish that it could be like that<br>

                    When you're with him, do you call his name<br>
                    Like you do when you're with me, does it feel the same?<br>
                    Would you leave if I was ready to settle down?<br>
                    Or would you play it safe and stay? <br>
