      <p>With nearly 75% of it covered in boreal forest, Finland is a top spot for tree-lovers. One of the most stunning Finnish forest-and-lake-studded wildernesses is Oulanka National Park, just near the Arctic circle and on the border with Russia. Autumn is a lovely time here when the Scotch pines, spruces and silver birches are painted with mellow colours and an assortment of fungi spring up on the forest floor. Although when snow falls, the scenery is pure magic too. Reindeer live in this remote place, as do wolves, lynx, bears, wolverines, pine martens and elk.</p>

The landscape is made up of pine forests, river valleys with sandy banks and rapids, and in the north of vast mires. It has a unique river ecosystem and is an example of untouched and unlogged boreal forest, close to the arctic circle, which is protected by World Wide Fund for Nature from intensive reindeer herding. The area is rich in animal and plant species, even endangered ones. Near the  center of visitor is the Oulanka Research Center, which is part of the Thule Institute and was established in 1966 to facilitate research in biological and geological sciences. The research center also offers its facilities to visiting tourists or hikers, during the less busy seasons. " '>See More...</button>

        <p>The vast Schwarzwald (Black Forest) drapes across the mountainous Baden-Württemberg region in southwest Germany. With its pretty lakes, shady valleys, mountain villages and, of course, thick evergreen forests filled with gorgeously green fir and pine trees, it is a gorgeous scene. Although with such dense foliage, the area can be a little dark and spooky at times, which explains why the Brothers Grimm set so many of their fairy tales in this bewitching forest. </p>

And yet what makes this national park truly special is that nature is left to run wild here. In fact, some areas have been left to develop without any human intervention for more than 100 years."

        <p>The ancient Belgian forest of Hallerbos, or the Blue Forest, is beautiful all year-round but it really springs to life in April when countless bluebells burst through the earth and bloom on its dappled forest floor. As the seasonal display sweeps across the forest like a gorgeous natural purple carpet, the park usually becomes even more popular with walkers. A Bluebell Trail goes right through the heart of the forest, which is just 12.5 miles (20km) south of Brussels, so the delicate flowers don't get trampled. As well as elegant beech trees, the magical woodland also has giant sequoia trees.</p>

        <p>The Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, near the UNESCO site of Tenryu-ji Temple in the Arashiyama district, is one of Kyoto’s most photogenic sights. A walking path runs through the tranquil grove, lined by soaring stalks of bamboo. Known as bamboo alley, the green living tunnel has an otherworldly quality, especially when the giant fast-growing stems sway and rustle in the wind, causing the light to shift. It's absolutely mesmerising.</p>

There is also an attractive preserved town area near the Adashino Nenbutsuji Temple. Arashiyama becomes most attractive (and busy) around early April and the second half of November when the cherry blossom and fall color seasons usually peak. During the summer months, traditional cormorant fishing is practiced on the Hozu River for tourists to watch. Another good time to visit is during December has Hanatoro illumination, when lanterns line the streets and bamboo groves. " '>See More...</button>
